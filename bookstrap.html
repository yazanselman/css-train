            Laura Dave wins this year’s Mystery & Thriller award for The Last
            Thing He Told Me, in which a mother and her stepdaughter try to
            unwind a lethally knotted secret. When Owen Michaels disappeared, he
            left his new wife, Hannah, a single cryptic message: Protect her.
            The note clearly refers to Bailey, Owen’s 16-year-old daughter. But
            why? The U.S. Marshals want to know, too.

            It’s August 1983, and the Riva clan’s legendary end-of-summer party
            in Malibu is quickly going off the rails. Taylor Jenkins Reid’s
            jagged ode to the 1980s explores the combustible nature of family
            secrets, severe heartbreak, and Too Much Alcohol. Reid has a way
            with recent history. She won the Historical Fiction category in 2019
            for her 1970s pop parable, Daisy Jones & the Six.

            Prolific author Sarah J. Maas notches her sixth GCA prize with this
            fourth installment in the insanely popular series A Court of Thorns
            and Roses. Maas’ imaginative world-building is something to behold—a
            kind of fractal blossoming of fantasy, romance, and adventure in the
            realms of the fae. Bonus trivia: The series has been officially
            optioned for adaptation on the streaming platform Hulu.

            Engineer-turned-novelist Andy Weir is on a crazy run. Best career
            switch ever? Project Hail Mary—concerning a resourceful astronaut
            and an extinction-level event—is Weir’s third nomination…and his
            third win. As with his previous books The Martian and Artemis,
            Project Hail Mary is final evidence that old-school hard science
            fiction is back. Quantum physics! Chemistry! Exobiology!
            Aerodynamics! It actually is rocket science.

            Author Grady Hendrix has carved out his own unique domain in horror
            by playing around with the genre’s blurry edges and recurring
            tropes. His latest novel—and winner of this year’s Best Horror
            award—considers the scary movie concept of the final girl, the one
            victim who fights back, defeats the killer, and lives to see another
            day. Hendrix’s open question: What if some of these women got
            together?
